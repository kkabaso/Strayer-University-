<h2>Porsche 718 Boxster  </h2>

<p>
WHAT WE LIKE: The combination of Porsche dynamics, 350 horsepower pushing a feathery 3090 pounds, and open-air romanticism continues to
 be one of our office’s great shared joys. <img src="5.jpg" alt="BMW"  style="width:100px; height:auto; padding:5px; float: right; caption: bottom;
 text-align: center; margin-bottom: 12px; color: yellow;">  That’s true if you’re setting a blistering pace on a desolate back road or loafing through
 town on a Sunday cruise. With just over 32,000 miles on the odometer, our Porsche 718 Boxster S roadster continues to collect praise bordering on
 hyperbole from anyone who drives it. Senior Buyer’s Guide editor Rich Ceppos captured the consensus in a more measured voice after a weekend with 
our Boxster S. “This is one of the best cars Porsche builds,” he wrote in the Boxster’s logbook. “Not because it’s the fastest, or sharpest-steering, or has the most grip. But because it feels great while being effortless—so
 comfortable, so joyful—with a great ride despite the meaty 19-inch tires.”.Comparison Tests give consumers a better idea of how the competition stacks up. Click on our most recent

<h2>2018 Mercedes-Benz E-class Wagon </h2>

<p>
May just be the most well-rounded new car on the market. Quick, comfortable, luxurious, beautiful, and practical, it really does 
do it all—and with oodles of elegance and flair.<img src="6.jpg" alt="BMW"  style="width:100px; height:auto; padding:5px; float: left; caption: bottom;text-align: center;
margin-bottom: 12px; color: yellow;"> The model has offered this rare combination of space and grace for decades, and the latest generation of the venerable E-class 
wagon, code-named S213 and introduced for 2017, fits into a long tradition of longroof excellence from the German automaker.</p>
